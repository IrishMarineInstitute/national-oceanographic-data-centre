				<h2>Data Management Plans</h2>
				<h3>Why compile a Data Management Plan?</h3>
				<p>Data Management Plans are a key element of good data management practice, and as such are required by many funding bodies either before funding is released, 
				or as an early project deliverable. For example, in the European Commission's Horizon 2020 funding programme a Data Management Plan must be submitted withing
				the first six months of a project.</p>
				<p>A Data Management Plan can help to identify opportunities to reuse and share the data a project or programme is creating. It can also serve as an "early 
				warning" mechanism to help highlight and communicate any data or IT requirements and issues.</p>
				<h3>What is a Data Management Plan?</h3>
				<p>A Data Management Plan describes what data will be created during a project, how they will be stored during the project, how they will be archived at the end of the project and how access will be granted (where appropriate). Although a Data Management Plan should be prepared before a project begins, it must be referred to and reviewed throughout, as well as after the project, so that it remains relevant.</p>
				<p>Most data generated during a project can be archived and shared under the Marine Institute's Data Policy. However, some data will be classified as confidential, personal or sensitive under that Policy. sensitive than others. A Data Management Plan aids in identifying issues related to data confidentiality, data security and copyright before initiating a project.  Any challenges to data sharing (e.g. data confidentiality) should be critically considered in a Data Management Plan, with solutions proposed to optimise data sharing.</p>
				<h3>What to put into a Data Management Plan</h3>
				<p>It is recommended that a Data Management Plan covers the following broad areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Overview of the dataset to be produced by the project / programme</li>
					<li>How the dataset will be created or collected</li>
					<li>What documentation and supporting information (metadata) will be included with the dataset</li>
					<li>What legal or ethical considerations are needed in handling the dataset</li>
					<li>How the dataset will be stored & how it will be backed up</li>
					<li>Selection & preservation</li>
					<li>How the data will be shared and who it will be shared with</li>
					<li>Who will be responsible for carrying out the data management and what resources will be required to act on the Data Management Plan</li>
				</ul>
				A Data Management Plan template can be accessed <a href="./web-assets/doc/dataManagementPlanTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
			</div>
			<div id="dataManagementRequirements">
				<h2>Data Management Requirements and Acceptance Criteria</h2>
				<p>The requirements document should contain an agreed set of clear requirements for the data being produced. It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of requirements, rather a high level set of functional requirements that the process must achieve. These requirements maybe either prerequisites in order to commence a data process or requirements to be met in the design or output of a data process. For example, for the Marine Institute's process to publish data through an instance of an <a href="https://erddap.marine.ie" target="_blank">Erddap server</a>, prerequisites include: a dataset must have a public-facing record in the Marine Institute's data catalogue; and that the dataset must not contain personal, sensitive personal, confidential, or otherwise restricted data. In addition, the criteria for successfully meeting these requirements should be specified, ensuring the data produced meets the needs of consumers of the data.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="processFlows">
				<h2>Process Flows</h2>
				<p>A Process Flow is a visual representation of an activity or series of activities, using standard business notation, illustrating the relationship between major components 294 and demonstrating the logical sequence of events. A Process Flow describes 'the what' of an activity and a  <a href="#standardOperatingProcedures">Procedure</a> describes 'the how'. Together they form part  of a Data Management Framework. The Process Flow may be split across multiple levels, but at the highest level should encompass the complete lifecycle of the data process. Process flow mapping involves gathering everyone involved in the process (administrators, contractor, scientists) together and determining what makes that process happen: inputs, outputs, steps and process time. A process map takes that information and represents it visually.</p>
				<p>A complete Process Flow can provide a clear vision of the future. After pinpointing problems and proposing solutions, there is an opportunity to re-map the process to what it should be. This shares the big picture with a team; each contributing member is then able to carry out improvements with a shared vision in mind. An example process flow for an ocean modelling dataset is shown in Fig. 4.</p>		<p>A process flow highlights duplicate processes across an organisation as well as variant practices, allowing an organisation to prune out the inefficient and propagate the most effective.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="standardOperatingProcedures">
				<h2>Standard Operating Procedures</h2>
				<p>A Standard Operating Procedure is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled to perform the activities described by the Process Flow. Depending on complexity there can be multiple Standard Operating Procedures contained in a single Process Flow. Within the context of this implementation pack, the Process Flow and the Standard Operating Procedure are the main mechanisms used to capture and retain organisational knowledge. A template for Standard Operating Procedures has been developed as part of the Implementation Pack, and covers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Purpose and scope of the procedure</li>
					<li>Abbreviations and terminology used in the procedure</li>
					<li>Roles and responsibilities required to carry out the procedure</li>
					<li>Detailed description of the procedure</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Data acquisition</li>
						<li>Data processing</li>
						<li>Data storage</li>
						<li>Data access and security</li>
						<li>Data quality control</li>
						<li>Data backup and archive</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Reporting requirements (including legislative requirements on data delivery)</li>
					<li>Recommendations to improve the procedure</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Where appropriate, the Standard Operating Procedures should be migrated from plain documentation to automated workflows, such as Jupyter notebooks, to demonstrate reproducibility in the data processing workflow.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="dataProvenance">
				<h2>Data Provenance</h2>
				<p>Within the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/" target="_blank">Findable Accessible Interoperable Reproducible (FAIR)</a> principles of data management:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data must be described with rich metadata (that is information about the data</li>
					<li>Metadata must be registered in a searchable resource</li>
					<li>Metadata must be associated with detailed provenance</li>
					<li>Metadata must meet domain-relevant community standards</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to help acheive these aims, the Marine Institute's National Marine Data Centre has developed the data catalogue at <a href="http://data.marine.ie" target="_blank">data.marine.ie</a> and a set of guidelines for submitting both metadata and data.</p>
				<p>To generate an entry in <a href="http://data.marine.ie" target="_blank">data.marine.ie</a>, a minimum set of information tracing the provenance or lineage of a dataset is required. This allows data to be clearly traced back to its owner and originator to give them full credit for creating the dataset, and also aids the reusability of the dataset. A provenance sheet template is available <a href="./web-assets/doc/provenanceSheetTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, which should contain information on the following aspects of the dataset:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Dataset name</li>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Originator information</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dataset owning organisation</li>
						<li>Contact details for a responsible team or individual in the dataset owning organisation</li>
						<li>If the data are published online, a URL to access the data</li>
					</ul>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Dataset details</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dataset abstract - covering the "who", "what", "when", "where", "why" and "how" of the dataset's collection or creation</li>
						<li>A lineage statement - describing the processes and procedures used in the compilation or creation of the dataset and providing an audit trail for steps taken to modify any original data</li>
						<li>Time span of the dataset</li>
						<li>Spatial or Coordinate Reference System used in the dataset</li>
						<li>Detailed descriptions of the parameters contained within the dataset, where possible referencing terms from the British Oceanographic Data Centre's Parameter Usage Vocabulary (<a href="https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/vocabularies/vocabulary_search/P01/" target="_blank">P01</a>)</li>
						<li>When was the dataset last updated?</li>
						<li>When will the dataset be next updated?</li>
					</ul>
					<li class="topLevelProvenance">Dataset usage terms</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The license under which the data are being made available</li>
						<li>Are there any General Data Protection Regulation issues wirthin the dataset?</li>
						<li>Which of the classifications from the Marine Institute <a href="https://www.marine.ie/Home/sites/default/files/MIFiles/Docs/DataServices/Marine%20Institute%20Data%20Policy%202017.pdf" target="_blank">data policy</a> does the dataset fall under?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Open data</li>
							<li>Environmental data</li>
							<li>Reporting data</li>
							<li>Intermediate data</li>
							<li>Confidential data</li>
							<li>Personal data</li>
							<li>Sensitive personal data</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Can the data be made available for third parties to view or download (or both)?</li>
						<li>When should the data originator be nezt contacted to ensure all the information supplied remains up-to-date?</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>All datasets submitted to the National Marine Data Centre at the Marine Institute must be accompanied with a completed provenance sheet.</p>
